		<p> My name is Mallory Louis and I am a student at the University of Wisconsin Madison. I am currently majoring in Communication Arts with certificates in both Sports Communication and Digital Studies. With this given coursework, I aspire to work within the sports industry with a career relating to digital media content creation. </p>

		<p> For as long as I can remember, sports have been my passion. Growing up in a competitive family with two brothers, sports have consumed my life. I grew up loving every aspect of sports from watching them, playing them, studying them...the list goes on! All this experience at a young age leads me to where I am now, aspiring to become a professional in the sports media industry.</p>

		<p> This website is meant to highlight both my past experiences and future aspirations of where I hope to be one day. Thank you! </p>
